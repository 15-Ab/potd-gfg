## A very Happy Near Year to all you guys.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Remainder storing.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- I created a helper array to store the remainders ( as possible remainders will be from 0 to 'k-1')
- - filled it with a for loop iteration
- Checked every remainder in 'help' array
- - if the remainder and its complementary both aren't same , then also it would be impossible to divide them in pairs
                return false;

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(l)$$
$$l$$ : length of given array
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $$O(k)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
// User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    public boolean canPair(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Code here
        int[] help = new int[k];  // to store the count of remainders ( as possible remainders will be from 0 to 'k-1')
        for( int a : nums){
            int t = a % k;
            if( t < 0){     // in case if remainder is negative ( in case of negative 'a')
                t += k;
            }
            help[t]++;
        }

        if( help[0] % 2 != 0){  // as if there will be odd number of '0' remainder then it would be impossible to divide them in pairs
            return false;
        }
        
        for( int i = 1; i <= k/2; i++){
            if(  help[k-i] != help[i]){  // if the remainder and its complementary both aren't' , then also it would be impossible to divide them in pairs
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
